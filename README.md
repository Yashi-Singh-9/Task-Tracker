# Task Tracker

## Description

Task Tracker is a simple, intuitive to-do list application that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. You can add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them as necessary. The application dynamically updates the task list without reloading the page, providing a seamless user experience.

This project is ideal for beginners to understand the basics of DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript and CSS styling. It serves as an excellent starting point for building more advanced task management applications.

Explore the project via the [live demo here](https://codepen.io/Yashi-Singh/pen/QWXXeGJ).

### Features:
- **Add Task**: Create new tasks by entering text and pressing the Enter key or clicking the Add Task button.
- **Task Completion**: Toggle between pending and completed tasks by clicking the checkbox next to each task. Completed tasks are shown with a strikethrough.
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks by clicking the trash can icon next to each task.
- **Dynamic Sorting**: Pending tasks are listed first, followed by completed ones for better task management.

### Alternatives:
This Task Tracker is designed for simplicity and small-scale personal use. For more advanced features, such as multi-user collaboration, notifications, or priority labeling, alternatives like [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) or [Trello](https://trello.com/) might be better suited.
